## scala\_kernel

This is a no-frills jupyter kernel to run the scala shell.  It provides no support
for inline graphics or incremental output.  It was derived from my spark\_kernel
repo.  So if there are other uses of jupyter and scala that you need besides inside spark 
you can try this kernel.

To install scala\_kernel, run in this directory the script install.sh.
The script requires pip and python3 and uses sudo.
